1. Skips aren't working as they should.
ex: Player 1 puts down a skip, it doesn't skip the turn of player 2
instead, player 2 starts their turn and the skip magically turns into a wild card that can be picked up
2. Discard pile is randomized every turn, when it should really only be randomized on turn 1, then not randomized otherwise.
